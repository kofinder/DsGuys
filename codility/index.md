# Recursion
1) Same operation is performed multiple with different inputs
2) In every step we try to make the problem smaller
3) We mandatorily need to have a base condition, which tells system when to stop recursion

# Grredy Algoirthm

# Divide & Conquer Algoirthm
1) Divide: This involves dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems.
2) Conquer: Solve sub-problems by calling recursively until solved.
3) Combine: Combine the sub-problems to get the final solution of the whole problem.
