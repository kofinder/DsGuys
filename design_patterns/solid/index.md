# Single Responsibilty Principle
- A class/method should have one reason to change
- A class/method should have only one responsibility
- A class/method should be related to a single purpose
- Speration of concerns - different class handling different, indenpendent tasks/problem

# Open-Closed Principle
- Class sould be open for extenstion but closed for modification

# Liskov Substition Principle
- You should be able to substitute a base type for subtype

# Interface Sergation Principle
- Don't put too much function into an interface; split into seperate interface
- YAGIN - You Ain't Going to Need It


# Why we need SOLID or its benefits
- Better Testability
- Reduces coupling
- Removes Duplication
- Increases Readability
- Increases Extensibility
