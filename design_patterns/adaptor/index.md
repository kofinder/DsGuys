# Adaptor
    - A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to require interface Y.

# Summary
    - Implementing an Adapter is easy
    - Determine the API you have and the API you need
    - Create a component which aggregates (has a reference to,..)  the adapte
    - Intermediate representations can pile up: use caching and other optimizations
